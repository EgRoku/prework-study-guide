        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when we want to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>External CSS is the most common way to style a webpage because it allows us to keep all CSS rules in a seperate file</li>
          <li>Seperation of concerns is a term used to refer to seperating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want on the outside of an element; margin property of 0 indicates NO extra space</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside the element; not to be confused with margin</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase. </li>
          <li>Link element creates an extension to an external file</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current doc and the linked doc</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
